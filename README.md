This project was born out of a shared passion for solving real-world Job challenges through technology. It all started during our time at Holberton School, where we were encouraged to tackle meaningful problems and innovate. Inspired by job recruitment agencies we embarked on this journey to create something impactful. We began brainstorming ideas last month this drive us into developing this project, and finally completed the project on the 3nd june 2024.This project serves as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. Holberton School is an innovative learning experience that prepares students for careers in the tech industry.
